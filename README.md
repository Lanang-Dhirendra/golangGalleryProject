# Mini Project Gallery

### Personal full-stack project

This project is a local (for now) web gallery that lets you see other photos uploaded in this web.

This project uses Go for backend and frontend (somehow), net/http library for serving over the web, and MySQL for database.

It's kinda messy for now, so it will be upgraded in the future to make it cleaner, safer, and use better tech.
